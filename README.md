The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data along with corresponding advertising expenses across different channels such as TV, radio, and newspaper. 
Each entry in the dataset represents sales figures for a particular period along with corresponding advertising expenditure on different media channels.
The trained linear regression model demonstrates promising results in predicting sales based on advertising expenditure. By analyzing the coefficients of the model, 
we can identify the relative impact of each advertising channel on sales. 
Furthermore, visualizing the regression line provides valuable insights into the relationship between advertising expenses and sales.
